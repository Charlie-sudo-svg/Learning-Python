# 100 Days of Python - By Charlie


Welcome to my journey of learning Python in 100 days! I'm documenting every step of the process — from the basics to building full projects — to improve my skills, share what I learn, and stay consistent throughout
the 100 days. 

Some days will be shorter than others, but by the end of the 100 days, the goal is to be proficient in python.
